# Ecommerce Application Backend

A robust and scalable backend system for an e-commerce platform that handles **user management, authentication/authorization, product catalog, order processing, payment integration, and refund handling** — similar to a backend for a private online store.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Most online stores rely on third-party solutions for backend services, which can limit flexibility, security, and scalability. Merchants need a **secure, customizable, and self-hosted backend** to manage users, orders, and payments efficiently.
